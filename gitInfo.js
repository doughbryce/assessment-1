/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

let gitDefinition = `git is a local version control software that will keep track of your code revision history. It acts like checkpoints in a video game, where you can expirament with the code and return to the last save point in the event that something goes terribly wrong, which it will.`;

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

let gitHubDefinition = `similar to git, git hub is a remote, cloud based, version control system. it enables checkpoint saving, like git, but also allows you to share code with other developers and push your code to remote servers, giving it another layer of protection against the inevitable disasters.`;

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

let gitInitDefinition = `git init is the first step in the git lifecycle. it is how you initialize a repository with the git software, essentially saying - sign up the current directory with git.`;

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

let gitCloneDefinition = `git clone is exactly what it sounds like - it will duplicate whatever repository is specified, creating a copy of that repo and enabling it to be manipulated without having to alter the original files.`;

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
